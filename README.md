Abstract: Our main metric we focused on is safety. Two datasets we used to measure safety are Police Arrest Data (shows amount of arrests per neighborhoods) and Non-Traffic Citations Data (shows amount of low-criminal offenses per neightbor. Using these, we found out that Mount Oliver and Ridgemont are the safest neighborhoods. Therefore, they are the best neighborhoods in Pittsburgh.
